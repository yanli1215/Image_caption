I would like to express my deepest gratitude towards my supervisor, Associate Professor Chng Eng Siong, for his guidance and the invaluable advice he has given me throughout my Final Year Project. I am very appreciative of the weekly meetings we had together with his team, during which he clarified any questions I had regarding the project and gave me direction for my research. I would also like thank Dr. Pham Vun Tung and Andrew Koh from Prof. Chng's team for their help and advice during this period.\\

I would also like to express my deepest appreciation to my industry supervisor, Dr. Xiao Xuhong, for her support and valuable advice throughout this project. Despite being busy with her own work, she periodically reached out to me to impart helpful suggestions to the problems I faced.\\

Finally, I would like to thank Wahdiah Mohamed Safit from Hardware Lab 1 for her assistance with the NTU GPU Server throughout this entire project.
